# React Part Time Class Final Project

## Project Name

National Park Finder

## Project Links

- [N/A]()

## Project Description

I want to make a site the filters info about the different National Parks. See the [nps.gov](https://www.nps.gov/state/wa/index.htm) site for Washington. Thoughts about how this would work at the filter parts by state, maybe by type (if I do more that just the BIG national parks), or by features, or activities. 

## Wireframes

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- List Parks
- Show a list of activities for each park
- Show an image of each park
- Other infor about each park

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Filter List of Parks
- Show photo gallery
- incorperate React Router
